# rossmann_store_sales_prediction
This repository contains a predictive model for Rossmann drugstores to improve their daily sales forecasts. Currently, store managers need to forecast sales up to six weeks in advance, resulting in varying accuracy due to their unique circumstances. Our model aims to provide more accurate forecasts to aid in decision-making processes.
